**Study Notes: Photosynthesis****Introduction*** Plants have the ability to make their own food through photosynthesis* Photosynthesis is not unique to plants; some protists and bacteria can also perform this process* Plants are major producers in food webs, providing oxygen, medications, and food for humans and other organisms**Photosynthesis Equation*** 6 CO2 + 6 H2O + light energy â†’ C6H12O6 (glucose) + 6 O2* Similarities with aerobic cellular respiration:	+ Reactants in photosynthesis are products in cellular respiration	+ Products in photosynthesis are reactants in cellular respiration* Plants make their own glucose, whereas animals obtain glucose from their diet**Light Capture and Pigments*** Plants use light-capturing molecules called pigments* Chlorophyll is a common pigment that absorbs red and blue light, but reflects green light, giving plants their green color* Other pigments absorb different wavelengths of light, explaining why plants can have different colors* Chloroplasts contain pigments and are the site of photosynthesis**Photosynthesis Processes*** **Light-Dependent Reactions (Light Reactions)**	+ Occur in thylakoids (grana) within chloroplasts	+ Light is captured, water is split, and oxygen is produced	+ ATP and NADPH are produced and will be used in the Light-Independent Reactions* **Light-Independent Reactions (Calvin Cycle or Dark Reaction)**	+ Occur in the stroma of chloroplasts	+ Carbon dioxide is fixed, and ATP and NADPH from the Light-Dependent Reactions are used	+ Glucose is produced through a complex series of pathways**Adaptations for Efficient Photosynthesis*** Plants have adaptations to perform photosynthesis efficiently in different environments* Examples of adaptations include diversity in leaf shapes, coverings, and pigments* CAM photosynthesis is an adaptation that allows plants like cacti to conserve water in hot desert environments**Key Concepts*** Photosynthesis**: the process by which plants, protists, and some bacteria produce glucose from light energy* **Light-Dependent Reactions**: the process by which light energy is used to produce ATP and NADPH* **Light-Independent Reactions (Calvin Cycle)**: the process by which carbon dioxide is fixed and glucose is produced using ATP and NADPH from the Light-Dependent Reactions* **Chlorophyll**: a pigment that absorbs red and blue light and reflects green light, giving plants their green color* **CAM Photosynthesis**: an adaptation that allows plants to capture carbon dioxide at night and use it during the day, conserving water in hot desert environments
